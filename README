QiBuild
=======

This projects aims to make compilation of cmake project easy.

Goals:
 - no need to specify a toolchain file to build with system libraries, toolchain file is needed only to change the compiler when *cross-compiling*.
 - be standard as much as possible. (generated *Config.cmake should be selfcontained)
 - use standard path for *Config.cmake


=== QiBuild ===
#should work on a single project
#if no .qibuild if found create and use ~/.qibuild? (finding project may need tweaking)
qibuild init
qibuild configure
qibuild make
qibuild install

=== QiToolchain ===
#store toolchain in the home? ~/.config/qi/toolchain/{config, tc1/, tc2/,..}?
qitoolchain create <name> <feed>
qitoolchain install <project>
qitoolchain uninstall <project>
qitoolchain status

=== QiSrc ===
#.qisrc ?
qisrc init <feed>
qisrc add <name> [url]
qisrc pull
qisrc status
qisrc push
qisrc reset
qisrc clean
