QiBuild TODO
============

Mandatory:
* configure/make: use buildconfig more
** The build folder should be build-<toolchainname>[-<configname>][-release]
** take cmake flags into account

* configstore:
** merge dependencies and cflags properly

* handle multiple build configuration:

* doc

* cmake
** add an option to only do bootstrap (to replace the bootstrap action)
** guess generator

* make
** guess msbuild, etc.. path


Future:
* project dependencies can depends on cmake flags. This allow bringing dependencies
  only when a specific cmake flags is used. or the opposite?

* handle binary project: create a class like toc that work with binary?
