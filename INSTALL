qiBuild Install
===============

Using the git repository
-------------------------

Use this method if you wish to use qibuild from the git repository.

After this is done, you just have to pull the git repository to
have an up-to-date qibuild.

This is the preferred method right now.


Linux, Mac, Windows from ``git-bash`` or mingw
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Simply run::

  ./generate-sourceme.sh

And then patch your ``~/.profile`` to look like::

  source /path/to/qibuild/sourceme.sh


This makes it possible to use ``qibuild`` without
setting ``PYTHONPATH``, and adds some tools to your shell,
such as ``qicd``

Windows from cmd.exe
+++++++++++++++++++++


* Make sure ``c:\Python27`` and ``c:\Python27\scripts`` are in ``%PATH%``
  (adapt these paths to reflect your Python's installation)

Then run::

  install-qibuild.bat


Net that you won't be able to use ``qicd`` from the ``cmd.exe``


Packaging qibuild
-----------------


Just use ``setup.py`` as usual.

Not that qibuild's CMake files will be installed to ``<prefix>/share/cmake``,
regardless of the platform.
