TODO
====

CMake:
* finish qi_use_lib (handle version, handle component)
* do something nice with static/shared libraries
* fix linker problems when using toolchain and third party libraries
* modules: decide weither clean/fpath/flib/depends/export_* is part of the public qiBuild API (rename to qi_fpath, qi_flib, qi_fdepends ?)
* export lib does not fail when REQUIRED is set

qiBuild:
* configstore: merge dependencies and cflags properly
* doc
* fix install component (only have two components: runtime and devel)

qiSrc:


DOC:
 * add tutorials:
  - using toolchain
  - build configurations
 * cmake: document +_INCLUDE_DIRS+, +_LIBS+, ....
 * use cmake to generate documentation !

Install:
  * find a way to install cmake files along with python stuff.
(right now, after running python setup.py install, no cmake
stuff can be found :/)
