TODO

CMake:
* finish rewriting stage_*
  - maybe we should do something like:
     qi_create_lib(foo)
     qi_stage_lib(foo
      [INCLUDE_DIRS] ...
      [DEFINITIONS] ...
      [DEPENDS] ...
     )
     (INCLUDE_DIRS, DEFINITIONS and DEPENDS
     being guessed if not given)
* Convention:
  - qi_add never stages
  - qi_create calls qi_add then qi_stage

* finish qi_use_lib (handle version, handle component)
* toolchain support (iphone, mingw32-cross, android, ..)
* wrapper for old t001chain stuff
* do something nice with static/shared libraries
* fix linker problems when using toolchain and
  third party libraries

qiBuild:
* configstore: merge dependencies and cflags properly
* doc
* fix install component

qiSrc:


DOC:
 * add tutorials:
  - using toolchain
  - build configurations
 * cmake: document +_INCLUDE_DIRS+, +_LIBS+, ....
 * use cmake to generate documentation !

Install:
  * find a way to install cmake files along with python stuff.
(right now, after running python setup.py install, no cmake
stuff can be found :/)
