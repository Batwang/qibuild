TODO
====

CMake:
* finish qi_use_lib (handle version, handle component, handler error
  messages properly)

* fix linker problems when using toolchain and third party libraries on mac
* export lib does not fail when REQUIRED is set

qiBuild:
* configstore: merge dependencies and cflags properly
* fix install component (only have two components: runtime and devel)

qiSrc:

* qisrc add should be able to read a base git url. For instance,
  qisrc add foo/bar.git, should read a setting and clone git://example.com:foo/bar.git


DOC:
 * Add a troubleshooting section and/or a FAQ

Install:
  * root's cmake list should honor CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX setting.
  * qibuild.get_cmake_root_path() could use cmake instead of
  trusting qibuild/config.py

Compat:
  * Improve compatibility with rosbuild
