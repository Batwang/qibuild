"""This package contains useful third-party modules.

argparse : qibuild's command line  parsing would be nothing without
           argparse. Note that this module is part of the stdlib since
           Python 2.7 and Python 3.2

xmlrunner : generate nice XML files from tests results. Used for
            automatic testing of qibuild
