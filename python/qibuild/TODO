QiBuild TODO
============

* configstore:
** merge dependencies and cflags properly

* doc

* cmake
** guess generator (or name it .. windows support)

* make
** guess msbuild, etc.. path (or name it .. windows support)


from future import:
* project dependencies can depends on cmake flags. This allow bringing dependencies
