Packaging a project
===================

You may want to distribute a pre-compiled package for an other
person to use. With qiBuild, this is easy.


Runtime package
---------------

Simply run:

----
qibuild package foo
----

This will compile in release and install the foo project in a temporary
directory, and generate a re-distributable binary package in
+QI_WORK_TREE/package/foo.tar.gz)+ (or foo.zip if you are on windows)

The archive will by default contain only the *runtime* components (executables,
dependent libraries, data ...)


Development package
-------------------


If you want to provide a pre-compiled package so that other people can
compile their own software with it, run:

----
qibuild package --devel foo
----

If you are using visual studio, this will generate a archive containing the
libraries built in debug and in release, along will the headers, the CMake files,
and so on.
