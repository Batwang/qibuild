Testing a project
=================


+CMake+ comes with a tool called +CTest+.

The idea is that you specify a executable to run, ctest lanches
the executable, and the test passes if the return code is 0.

Assuming you have add some tests in your project, you can test them
by running

----
qibuild test foo
----

On our case, this is simply going to launch the foo executable.

NOTE: the integration of +qiBuild+ with a tool like *CDash* is not covered in
      this document.
      +qiBuild+ works fine with +Hudson+, for those intersted in a continuous
      integration tool.
