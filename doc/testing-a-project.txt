Testing a project
=================


+CMake+ comes with a testing tool called +CTest+.

The idea of CTtest is that you specify a executable to run, CTest launches
the executable, and the test passes if the return code is 0.

Assuming you have added some tests in your project, you can test them
by running:

----
qibuild test foo
----

In our case, this is simply going to launch the +foo+ executable.

-------------

See link:unit-testing.html[Unit testing].


link:packaging-a-project.html[Next]: package the project.


NOTE: the integration of +qiBuild+ with tools like +CDash+ is not covered in
      this document.
      +qiBuild+ works fine with +Hudson+, for those intersted in a continuous
      integration tool.
