Creating a new project
======================


In this tutorial, we will simply create a new project:

Navigate to your QI_WORK_TREE and Enter:

----
qibuild create foo
----

(remember, for this to work on windows, you should have:
 * run install-qibuild.bat
 * put +C:\Python27+ and +c:\Python\Scripts+  in your +%PATH%+)

This will create a new project in QI_WORK_TREE/foo.

Let's have a look at what has been generated:

----
foo
|__  CMakeLists.txt
|__  main.cpp
|__  qibuild.cmake
|__  qibuild.manifest
----


* main.cpp is just a standard "Hello World"

* CMakeLists.txt : this is a script file that will be read by CMake to generate
makefiles, or Visual Studio solutions.

* qibuild.cmake : this file MUST be included by the CMakeLists.txt to find the qibuild/cmake
framework

* qibuild.manifest : this file MUST be present for qiBuild to know how to build the
foo project.



If you already have source code somewhere, all you have to do is:

* create a qibuild.manifest looking like

[source, ini]
----
[project foo]

----

* copy-paste the qibuild.cmake file from +qibuild/cmake/qibuild/templates/qibuild.cmake+
and make sure to include it in you root +CMakeLists+
