Creating a binary
=================

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create executables with the
+qiBuild+ framework

Requirements
------------

We assume you have followed the link:getting-started.html[Getting Started]
tutorial.


Basic CMake
-----------

Every +CMake+ project should begin with something like:

[source, cmake]
----
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6.4)
include(qibuild.cmake)
project(foo)
----

The first line is required by the cmake standards.

The second line includes the +qibuild.cmake+ file that you just copied from +qibuild+ sources.

Don't worry, the file will be automatically updated whenever the source changes.

The +project()+ call is just good practice.

Adding an executable
--------------------

To add an executable, simply call +qi_create_bin+.
The first argument is the name of the executable, followed by the sources
of the executable.
The paths of the sources are relative to the path where the +CMakeLists+ is
found, so you should create the +main.cpp+ right next to the +CMakeLists+

[source,cmake]
----
qi_create_bin(foo main.cpp)
----


If you are on UNIX, the executable will end up in +build/sdk/bin/foo+.

If you are using Visual Studio, the executable will be in:

+build/sdk/Debug/foo_d.exe+  (if you chose to build in debug)

or in

+build/sdk/Release/foo.exe+ (if you chose to build in release)


NOTE: To run directly the foo executable from Visual Studio, simply right-click
      on the +foo+ project and select "Choose as start up project", then press
      F5 as usual.
