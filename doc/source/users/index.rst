=====================

Introduction

This part of the doc is made for you if you are an only user of qibuild.
It means that you work on a project manage by qibuild.

You will learn to get sources, sync them, push commits and build them with
cross-toolchain or not.

If you want to add new projects, or create a qibuild work-tree from beginning run
