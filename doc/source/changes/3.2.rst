v3.2
=====

Command line
------------

* New command added: ``qitest``. This makes it possible to run the tests after
  they have been deployed to a remote host (assuming qibuild is installed on the
  remote host)

.. code-block:: console

  qibuild deploy --with-tests user@host:deploy
  ssh use@host
  cd deploy
  qitest run qitest.json


* Tests are no always configured (even the nightly tests), but are no longer
  built by default

.. code-block:: console

    ## In qibuild 3.1

    # running the normal tests (no performance tests, no nightly tests):
    qibuild configure         # configure only the normal tests
    qibuild make              # build only the normal tests
    qibuild test              # does not build anything, you have to run `qibuild make` if
                              # you changed the tests source code

    # running the performance tests:
    qibuild configure \
       -DWITH_PERF_TESTS=ON   # re-configure the whole project
    qibuild make              # re-build the normal test and the performance tests
    qibuild test -- perf      # run the performance tests


.. code-block:: console

    ## In qibuild 3.2

    # running the normal tests (no performance tests, no nightly tests):
    qibuild configure        # configure all the tests
    qibuild make             # does not build any tests
    qibuild test             # build the normal tests and run them

    # running the performance tests:
    qibuild test --perf      # build the performance tests and run them


* Better handling of concurrency:

  * ``ctrl-c`` can no longer cause deadlocks.
  * ``qibuild test`` displays a summary even when it has been interrupted
  * Python exceptions raised during tests no longer cause deadlocks.

Python
------

* Rewrite of the ``qibuild test`` implementation

  * Removed ``qibuild.ctest`` and  ``qibuild.performance``
  * Added ``qitest`` module, ``qibuild.test_runner`` and ``BuildProject.run_tests``

CMake
------

* Added ``qi_create_test_helper`` : this will create an executable that
  will be built when the tests are built, but is not an actual tests.
  Useful to create several tests with the same executable but different arguments:

.. code-block:: cmake

    # old:

    qi_create_test(foo foo.cpp NO_ADD_TEST)
    qi_add_test(foo_bar foo ARGUMENTS --bar)
    qi_add_test(foo_baz foo ARGUMENTS --baz)

.. code-block:: cmake

    # new:

    qi_create_test_helper(foo foo.cpp)
    qi_add_test(foo_bar foo ARGUMENTS --bar)
    qi_add_test(foo_baz foo ARGUMENTS --baz)

* Changed options:

  ``BUILD_TESTS`` is no longer used, use ``QI_WITH_TESTS=OFF`` instead to
  deactivate the tests completely (they won't even be configured)

* The implementation no longer calls upstream's ``add_test``, which means:

  * You cannot use ``ctest`` or ``make test`` to run the tests
  * The call to ``enable_testing()`` is no longer necessary
