v3.5
====

qisrc
-----

Remove the possibility to have several manifests in one worktree, as a consequence,
qisrc API changed quite a bit:

``qisrc manifest --list``  -> ``qisrc info``
``qisrc manifest default -g bar`` -> ``qisrc add-group, qisrc remove-group``
``qisrc manifest --check default /path/to/xml`` -> ``qisrc check-manifest /path/to/xml``

To help transition from 3.4, simply run ``tools/convert-3.4-worktree.py``


cmake
-----

Add wrappers for ``bison`` and ``flex``
