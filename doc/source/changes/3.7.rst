v3.7
====

General
--------

Warn when nesting worktrees are detected

qicd
----

* Go back to 3.5 behavior

qibuild
--------

* Write a ``path.conf`` in the .qi folder too
* Merge ``qitest.json`` files when installing using ``--with-tests``
* Fix  #24199: additional environment paths leaking from other configs
* Fix using ``--build-type=[RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel]`` with Visual Studio
* Fix using ``qibuild test`` with ``-p``
* Fix updating build profiles remotely. To get an up-to-date profile, you
  should first remove the ``<profiles>`` tag manually from ``.qi/qibuild.xml``

qidoc
------

* Fix crash when ``build_type`` is None
* Do not put doubles in ``qiapidoc_srcs``
* Fix bug with recent ``sphinx``: except ``SystemExit`` to prevent early exit

qipkg
------

* ``qipkg build``: allow usage of ``-j`` option
* Better error message when files from the pml do not exist
* Add support for meta packages
* Implement ``qipkg make-package --with-breakpad``

qipy
-----

* ``qipy bootstrap``: fix crash when calling ``pip install`` fails.
* Allow specifying modules, script and packages to install directly from the
  ``qiproject.xml`` instead of having to write a ``setup.py`` file

qisrc
------

* ``qisrc checkout``: skip checkout when project is already on the correct branch
* ``qisrc init`` : make manifest url argument optional
* ``qisrc``: raise when updating the manifest fails
* ``qisrc rebase``: make git fetch quiet when verbose is not set
* Fix issue when changing remotes: the new remote was added but the previous
  one never deleted
* ``qisrc list-groups``: sort the output

qitest
-------

* ``qitest run`` accept several ``-k`` options
* ``qitest run``: correctly set working directory
* ``qitest run`` allow specifying several build projects on the command line.
  As a consequence, paths to ``qitest.json`` files should now be specified using
  ``--qitest-json`` option.
* ``qitest run --nightly``: also run the normal tests.
* Do not overwrite generated XML files when return code is 1

cmake
------

* Look for boost shared libs on Windows
* ``Qt``: Remove ``QT_USE_QMAKE`` option. Instead just look for the
  ``qmake`` executable to include upstream CMake modules. Previous
  behavior can be achieved by setting ``QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE`` variable.
