v3.7
====

General
--------

* Warn when nesting worktrees are detected
* Print the name of the class of the exception along with its message
  when an uncaught exception occurs.

qicd
----

* Go back to 3.5 behavior

qibuild
--------

* Write a ``path.conf`` in the .qi folder too
* Merge ``qitest.json`` files when installing using ``--with-tests``
* Fix  #24199: additional environment paths leaking from other configs
* Fix using ``--build-type=[RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel]`` with Visual Studio
* Fix using ``qibuild test`` with ``-p``
* Fix updating build profiles remotely. To get an up-to-date profile, you
  should first remove the ``<profiles>`` tag manually from ``.qi/qibuild.xml``
  The ``tools/3.7-migration.py`` script can help you do that.

qidoc
------

* Fix crash when ``build_type`` is None
* Do not put doubles in ``qiapidoc_srcs``
* Fix bug with recent ``sphinx``: except ``SystemExit`` to prevent early exit

qilinguist
----------

* Add context support extraction for qilinguist

qipkg
------

* ``qipkg build``: allow usage of ``-j`` option
* Better error message when files from the pml do not exist
* Add support for meta packages
* Implement ``qipkg make-package --with-breakpad``

qipy
-----

* ``qipy bootstrap``: fix crash when calling ``pip install`` fails.
* Allow specifying modules, script and packages to install directly from the
  ``qiproject.xml`` instead of having to write a ``setup.py`` file
* Use ``exec`` in the ``./python`` script. This is required for ``qi::path``
  magic to work.

qisrc
------

* ``qisrc checkout``: skip checkout when project is already on the correct branch
* ``qisrc init`` : make manifest URL argument optional
* ``qisrc``: raise when updating the manifest fails
* ``qisrc rebase``: make git fetch quiet when verbose is not set
* Fix issue when changing remotes: the new remote was added but the previous
  one never deleted
* ``qisrc list-groups``: sort the output

qitoolchain
-----------

* Support for svn packages: just put a ``<svn_package>`` tag in the XML feed.
  ``qitoolchain update`` will cause all svn packages to be updated to the latest
  revision. You can also specify a revision using a ``revision`` attribute.

* Format of configuration files changed. Now only XML is used.
  * Versions of packages are now stored in a database
  * Since configuration of toolchain packages changed, you should re-create
    all of them from scratch. The ``tools/3.7-migration.py`` script can help
    you do that.

* ``qitoolchain update`` is now a no-op when there are no changes, thus
  preventing unnecessary rebuilds.

* Binary packages are now a 'flat' zip with a ``package.xml`` as first element
  containing metadata. Packages can now have runtime, build time and test time
  dependencies, the same way C++ projects can.

* Binary packages now contain install manifest files to track the list of files
  matching a given component (runtime, devel or test)

* ``qitoolchain add-package``: read name of the package (and other metadata)
  from ``package.xml``

* Packages generated by ``qibuild package`` now also contain SCM information
  when relevant

qitest
-------

* ``qitest run`` accept several ``-k`` options
* ``qitest run``: correctly set working directory
* ``qitest run`` allow specifying several build projects on the command line.
  As a consequence, paths to ``qitest.json`` files should now be specified using
  ``--qitest-json`` option.
* ``qitest run --nightly``: also run the normal tests.
* Do not overwrite generated XML files when return code is 1

cmake
------

* Look for boost shared libs on Windows
* ``Qt``: Remove ``QT_USE_QMAKE`` option. Instead just look for the
  ``qmake`` executable to include upstream CMake modules. Previous
  behavior can be achieved by setting ``QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE`` variable.
* cmake modules: add ``curl``
