Install data
============


Let's assume the foo executable needs to read data from a file called
+foo.data+

When you install +foo+, you would like to have something looking like

----
bin/foo
share/foo/foo.data
----

(at least on UNIX)

So, create a folder named +share/foo+ and put a file names +foo.data+ in your
source tree.

Installing files
----------------

To install the files, simply use

[source, cmake]
----
qi_install_data(foo share/foo/foo.data)
----



Going further
-------------


Here we have just covered what the basics of what the +qibuild/cmake+ framework
can do for you.
