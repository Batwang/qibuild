Building a project
==================


Simple build
------------

Let's assume you only want to compile your project once.

Doing so is easy:

----
qibuild make foo
----

Or, to build in release, use:

----
qibuild make --release foo
----


Using an IDE
------------

qiBuild is based on +CMake+, which in turns knows how to generate project files for
a lot of IDEs : +XCode+, +Eclipse+, +Visual Studio+.

Here we are only dealing with the details for:

- QtCreator on Mac and linux

- Visual studio on windows.

qiBuild is known to work fine with these IDEs, there may be some work to do to be
able to use +XCode+ or +Eclipse+. Patches and tutorials welcome !


qiBuild and QtCreator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only thing to remember is that you should not let +QtCreator+ call cmake by
itself the first time.

Use +qibuild configure+, +qibuild make+ to be sure everything works fine.

Then open the root +CMakeLists+ in +qtcreator+.

You will be prompted to use a build directory, chose the one that was created by
+qibuild+.

+QtCreator+ will read the setting from the exising build directory, so everything
should work fine.


qiBuild and Visual Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have run +qibuild configure+, you will have a +.sln+ file generated in
your build directory.

Your solution should be already configured. Please avoid making changes to the
solution file by hand, they will be lost the next time you change a CMake file
or re-run CMake.
