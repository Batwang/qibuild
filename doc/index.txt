qiBuild
=======

Introduction
------------
qiBuild aims to make compilation of your sources easy. It manages
dependencies between projects and supports easy cross-compilation.
By default qiBuild uses libraries provided by your system, but you
can use qiToolchain to get a toolchain if you dont want to build
with your system libraries or want to cross-compile.


qiBuild is composed of two parts:

* the qiBuild CMake framework, that simplifies CMakeLists.txt writing.
* qibuild/qitoolchain command line programs, that builds projects taking dependencies into account.

For more detailed information look at the link:architecture.html[architecture].
