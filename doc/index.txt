qiBuild
=======

Introduction
------------
qiBuild aims to make compilation of your sources easy. It manages
*dependencies* between projects and supports *cross-compilation*.

By default qiBuild uses libraries provided by your system, but you
can also use qiToolchain to manage sets of pre-compiled packages (called
toolchains) if you want. Cross-compilation is then just a matter of
using a specific toolchain.

qiBuild is truly *cross-platform:* it is tested on Linux, Mac and Windows.
Being based on the well-known +CMake+ build system, it allows you to use
your existing tools such as +gcc+, +Makefile+, or +Visual Studio+.

The qiBuild framework tries hard to stand out of your way: it remains
*close to standards*, and will play nice with other build systems.

qiBuild is composed of two parts:

* the qiBuild CMake framework, that simplifies authoring CMakeLists.txt.
* the qibuild/qitoolchain command line tools, that help build projects
  while taking dependencies into account.
