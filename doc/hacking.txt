Hacking QiBuild
===============

Welcome, brave hacker !

Here are a few pointers to help you understand how
the code works.



== Advanced documentation

The qibuild framework is made in two parts: the first one
is a CMake framework (just simple wrappers around functions like
add_executable, find_library and so on)

The second (and easier) part of the framework is a set of
command-line tools to help you run cmake, manage dependencies,
and so on.
