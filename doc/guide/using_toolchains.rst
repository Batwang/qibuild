Using toolchains
================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your projects using pre-compiled
packages.


Requirements
------------

The requirements for this tutorial are the same as in
the :ref:`qibuild-managing-deps` tutorial.

You should have:

* a properly configured qiBuild worktree

* two projects, world and hello, with hello depending on the world library.

The goal of this tutorial is to manage to compile hello, using a pre-compiled
binary of world.

Creating the world package
--------------------------

Generating a package for the world project is done with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qibuild package world

This will create a package named ``hello.tar.gz`` in
``QI_WORK_TREE/package/hello.tar.gz`` (or hello.zip on windows)

Inside the package, you will have::

  world
  |__ include
      |__ world
         |__ world.h
      lib
         |__ libworld.so
      share
        cmake
          |__ world-config.cmake


.. note:: The archive generated by qibuid **always** contain
   a properly named top directory.
   This is annoying only when using the build-in zip extractor
   of Windows, you will end up with world/world/ ...),
   so get over it or just use 7zip.

The LFS hierarchy is still preserved, and it is the same as in ``build/sdk``.

The ``world-config.cmake`` is a standard CMake file, but it can be used even after
installing the world package, because it only uses relative paths.

So the world package is usable anywhere.

.. note:: The world-config.cmake does not even requires qibuild to be used by
  an other CMake project, all it does is calling standard CMake functions.

Using a toolchain
-----------------

First, you have to create a **toolchain** for qibuild to use:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qitoolchain create <TOOLCHAIN_NAME> --default

Not that you can choose any name for your toolchain, but is advised
to choose between this set of configurations:

* linux32
* linux64
* mac32
* mac64
* win32-vs2008
* win32-vs2010
* mingw

Here we will assume you chose ``linux32``

Here we used the ``--default`` option. If you don't use ``--default``, you
will have to use ``-c linux32`` for every qibuild command.

The only thing the ``default`` option does is to set ``QI_WORK_TREE/.qi/qibuild.cfg``
so that it looks like:

.. code-block:: ini

   [general]
   config = linux32

So it's easy to change your mind later.


This will create a directory looking like:
``~/.local/share/qi/toolchains/linux32/``

This is where every packages corresponding will be put.
put.

You can check that your toolchain has been created with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ qitoolchain status

   Toolchain linux32
   No feed
   No packages

Now you can use:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qitoolchain add-package -c linux32 world /path/to/worktree/package/world.tar.gz


You can check that your package has been added with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ qitoolchain status

  Toolchain linux32
  No feed
    Packages:
      foo
        in /home/user/.local/share/qi/toolchains/linux32/world


This will simply:

* copy the ``world`` package somewhere in you toolchain directory.

* configure some files so that qibuild knows that the
  ``linux32`` toolchain can provide the ``world`` package

When resolving dependencies of the ``hello`` project, qibuild will see that you use
a toolchain called ``linux32`` and that this toolchain provides the ``world`` project,
so itâ€™s enough to set ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATHS`` to ``path/to/linux/toolchain/world``

The ``world`` project will not be built when you use ``qibuild make hello``, unless you
specify it explicitly on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qibuild configure world hello

Creating toolchain feeds
------------------------

Now, that you have a nice local toolchain, and a ``world`` package,
you may want other people to be able to use the ``world`` package,
without them having to recompile it from source.

So here we are going to create a remote configuration file, so
that other developpers can simply download the ``world`` package from
a server

We will assume you have access to a FTP or a HTTP sever.


First, upload the world package, so that is accessible with the url:
``http://example.com/packages/world.tar.gz``

Next, create a ``fee.xml`` accessible with the url:
``http://example.com/feed.xml``, looking like

.. code-block:: xml

   <toolchain>

    <package
      name="world"
      url = "http://example.com/packages/world.tar.gz"
    />

  </toolchain>


Then, from an other machine, run

.. code-block:: console

   $ qitoolchain create linux32 http://example.com/feed.xml

  Getting package world from http://example.com/packages/world.tar.gz
  Toolchain linux32: adding package world


You can see that the feed has been store in qibuild configuration:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qitoolchain status

  Toolchain linux32
  Using feed from http://example.com/feed.xml
    Packages:
      foo
        in /home/user/.local/share/qi/toolchains/linux32/world




Full feed.xml specification
----------------------------

The full sepcifcation can be found in the
:ref:`toolchain-feed-syntax` section


Just for fun
------------

You can always add something like

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="../xsl/toolchain.xsl"?>


With an xsl looking like


.. code-block:: xml

  <html xsl:version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <body >
      <h2> Packages </h2>
      <ul>
        <xsl:for-each select="toolchain/package">
        <li>
          <a>
          <xsl:attribute name="href">
            <xsl:value-of select="@url" />
          </xsl:attribute>
          <xsl:value-of select="@name" />
          </a>
        </li>
        </xsl:for-each>
      </ul>
      <h2> Feeds </h2>
      <ul>
        <xsl:for-each select="toolchain/feed">
        <li>
          <a>
          <xsl:attribute name="href">
            <xsl:value-of select="@url" />
          </xsl:attribute>
          <xsl:value-of select="@url" />
          </a>
        </li>
        </xsl:for-each>
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>
